# WebDev-Final

## Description

This code represents a personal website for Isaak Henry. It includes sections such as "About Me," "Previous Work," "Projects," and "Contact." The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- The navigation bar at the top allows users to quickly jump to different sections of the website by clicking on the respective links.
- The "About Me" section includes a dynamically inserted image and a biography. The image and bio can be easily modified or updated.
- The "Previous Work" section features an accordion-style dropdown that allows users to view information about work experience, significant coursework, and programming languages.
- The "Projects" section dynamically creates cards for each repository listed in the JavaScript code. Each card displays the repository name, and when clicked, it opens the corresponding GitHub repository in a new tab.
- The "Contact" section includes a form where users can submit their name, email, and a message. Upon submission, the data is logged to the console.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the provided files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Navigate through the different sections using the links in the navigation bar.
